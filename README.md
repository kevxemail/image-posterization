## Color Space Vector Quantization

- Recreates an inputted image using only K different colors (posterizes), utilizing K Means clustering to implement color space vector quantization from scratch
- Reduced run time by 20% by implementing a different approach for choosing the K initial values, where the RGBS are divided K segments in a sorted list
- Reduced run time by 30% by reducing redundant calculations throughout
